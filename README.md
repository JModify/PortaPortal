# PortaPortal
PortaPortal is a Minecraft server plugin which adds throwable portals into the game. Upon portal item right click, a portal is built using a configured schematic file. Player(s) which run into this portal teleport to a configurable location, while the portal closes behind them soon after.

Plugin requires WorldEdit to be installed due to schematic integration.
Plugin supports EssentialsX integration, allowing you to set portal destinations to Essentials homes.
